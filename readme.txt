Accept advance payments on your WooCommerce store with ease. Increase customer flexibility and improve order management with our powerful and user-friendly WooCommerce Advance Payment plugin.

== Description ==

WooCommerce Advance Payment is a powerful WooCommerce extension that enhances your online store's payment options by adding an advanced payment feature. With WooCommerce Advance Payment, you can easily collect advance payments from customers, providing them with a flexible and convenient way to make partial payments before completing their order.

**Using WooCommerce Advance Payment** is straightforward. Simply install and activate the plugin, configure your advance payment settings, and the feature will seamlessly integrate into your WooCommerce checkout process. You can choose between making advance payments optional or required, depending on your business requirements.

**Here's how it works:** when customers proceed to checkout, they will see an additional option to make an advance payment. They can choose to pay a fixed amount or a percentage of their order total, based on your configuration. The advance payment amount is then deducted from the order total, giving customers a clear view of the remaining balance they need to pay upon receiving their order.

To further streamline the process, WooCommerce Advance Payment includes a Payment Information box where customers can provide specific details related to their payment. This information is securely stored and can be accessed by administrators in the WooCommerce admin area. This feature allows customers to communicate any relevant payment-related details, such as transaction numbers, wire transfer instructions, or other pertinent information.

One of the standout features of WooCommerce Advance Payment is its compatibility with popular translation plugins, making it easy to translate the plugin into multiple languages. This ensures that you can provide a localized experience to your customers, regardless of their language preference.
